1. Find the most relevant channel for your post. _(You probably can't go wrong with: [#promotions](https://modernagile.slack.com/archives/CDJL4CEB1))_
2. If you can't find an appropriate channel then PLEASE ASK FOR HELP -- BEFORE POSTING content.

_No promotions in #general or #watercooler!_ :thumbsup:
